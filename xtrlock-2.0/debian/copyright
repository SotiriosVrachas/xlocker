This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of Ian Jackson's xtrlock
utility.  This package provides a minimal X display lock program.

This package was put together by Stephen Early
<steve@greenend.org.uk>, from the source by Ian Jackson, which he
obtained from Usenet.  Apart from a couple of bugfixes the changes
were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian package
maintenance scheme, by adding various debian.* files.

This package is now maintained by Matthew Vernon <matthew@debian.org>.
